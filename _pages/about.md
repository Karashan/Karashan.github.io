I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Raghavan Lab] (https://labs.dana-farber.org/raghavanlab/) at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, and Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. I specialize in developing machine learning approaches to integrate diverse genomic data, infer biological networks, and identify novel therapeutic targets. I am currently involved in [Project Ex Vivo](https://exvivo.broadinstitute.org/), a collaborative effort between Microsoft and the Broad Institute aiming for defining, engineering, and targeting cell states in cancer.

 Originally from Shenzhen, I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities under the mentorship of [Dr. Chad Myers] (http://csbio.cs.umn.edu/). My doctoral research centered on developing computational methods for mapping and interpreting large-scale genetic interaction networks in human cells based on genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens. In addition to computational biology, I am passionate about skiing and classical music.
